# CIS7-Project
This program encrypts/decrypts a message inputted from the user using a key provided by the user. When the main.cpp file is first ran, the first thing the program asks for is the user to input a key which will be used for the encryption and decryption. The input for the key should be only alphabetical characters but if spaces, symbols, or numbers are inputted the program, the program will remove these characters automatically, leaving only the alphabetical characters (this also goes for the encryption and decryption input). After the key is inputted, a menu will appear with the choices of either encrypt or decrypt. Based on the user’s choice, they would have to enter the number next to their choice and press enter. If any other number is inputted the program will end. Based on the user’s choice, whether it be encryption or decryption, the user will be able to enter their message and after they press enter the program will display their final result (If you do Encryption first and then decryption, the program will display your previously decrypted message so that the user will be able to copy it). After the result is displayed, the program will loop back to the menu so that the user can continue encrypt and decrypt until they enter a different choice other than the given two choices. (The user will not be able to change their key after they entered it at the start of the program.)
